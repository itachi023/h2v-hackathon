# The Challenge

- In countless under-resourced schools across India, a single teacher often manages multiple grades in one classroom
- These educators are stretched thin, lacking:
  - Time and tools to create localized teaching aids
  - Resources to address diverse learning levels
  - Ability to personalize education for every child
- The challenge is to build a true AI companion that:
  - Lessens teacher burden
  - Amplifies their impact

## The Objective

Build an AI-powered teaching assistant ("Sahayak") that empowers teachers in multi-grade, low-resource environments. The agent must be a versatile tool for:

- Preparation
- Content creation
- Differentiation

## Key Features

1. **Generate Hyper-Local Content**
   - Allow teachers to make requests in local language (e.g., "Create a story in Marathi about farmers to explain different soil types")
   - Receive simple, culturally relevant content generated by Gemini

2. **Create Differentiated Materials**
   - Enable teachers to upload photos of textbook pages
   - Using multimodal Gemini model to instantly generate multiple worksheet versions
   - Tailored to different grade levels in the classroom

3. **Act as an Instant Knowledge Base**
   - Provide simple, accurate explanations for complex student questions
   - Support local language responses
   - Include easy-to-understand analogies (e.g., "Why is the sky blue?")

4. **Design Visual Aids**
   - Generate simple line drawings or charts based on teacher descriptions
   - Create materials easily replicable on blackboards
   - Explain concepts like the water cycle visually

5. **Go Beyond (Innovative Features)**
   - Audio-based reading assessments (using Vertex AI Speech-to-Text)
   - On-the-fly educational game generation
   - AI-powered weekly lesson planners that:
     - Structure activities
     - Save teachers valuable time

## Technical Requirements

- **Tech Stack**: Use of Google AI technologies is mandatory
- **Bonus Opportunity**: Special prize for:
  - Using Firebase Studio
  - Deploying the project
